# xord
minimal web app to help solve crosswords by applying regex to wordlist

xord is a trivial webapp to supply a http interface to find words in a wordlist by using any non-letter characters as wildcard.

My motivation to make this app was to gain understanding for asp.net core. It might have some interest for people with similar
leanings looking for a simple example on how to configure basic setup in asp.net core.
